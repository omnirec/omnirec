# xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland configuration for screen-recorder
#
# Install to: ~/.config/hypr/xdph.conf
#
# This configures XDPH to use our custom picker instead of hyprland-share-picker.
# The custom picker queries the main screen-recorder app for the user's selection
# instead of showing a picker dialog, creating a seamless recording experience.

screencopy {
    # Use our custom picker binary instead of hyprland-share-picker
    # The picker must be installed and accessible in PATH or provide full path
    custom_picker_binary = screen-recorder-picker
